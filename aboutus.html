<h1>The Creators</h1>
<p>The desginers and creators of Zone are Elijah Kerr, Jeffron Addy, and Nathaniel Adjei. The three young men came up with the idea after realizing that it is extremely hard for teens to focus in today's age of technology. With constant distractions such as text messaging, mobile games, and social media, Zone was created to help teens stay focused on their work for as long as they need to.</p>
